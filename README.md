# WEATHER-FORECASTING
Develop a user-friendly web interface to fetch and display weather information. Users should be able to input a location and view 
real-time conditions. The frontend will integrate with a weather API to retrieve data and present it clearly using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript for dynamic updates and an intuitive user experience.
